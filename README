The command
.\gradlew test connectedAndroidTest
can be run from the commandline in Android Studio to build and run the test and androidTest tasks, producing reports in the build/reports/test and build/output/reports/androidTest directories.

Objective: Using a RestTeplate with a gson converter compontent to convert html
objects into json objects to produce an android application that retrieves Chuck Norris jokes from the internet, one at a time, and displays them to the user one at a time. The user can request additional jokes. The project should be build with mulitiple flavors producing multiple apks.

About:
Following a YouTube example demonstrating the android gradle wrapper with an application that uses Rest and Json to get and interpret Chuck Norris Jokes from the internet. The video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bhbQdZLpIE .The author,Kenneth Kousen, uses Spring for Android to retrieve jokes from http://www.icndb.com/ and displays them to the user. The author also uses Robotium for testing the user interface.

Primary Goals: Learn more about Android Studio and the Gradle Wrapper for building multiple flavors.
Secondary Secondary: Learn more about REST, JSON, Gson, Mockito and Robotium.

How jokes are acquired:
The jokes are requested from the site  http://api.icndb.com using HTTP GET.
To fetch a random joke one can use http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random
The result of such a fetch is a json object of the form:
{ "type": "success", "value": { "id": 553, "joke": "China lets Chuck Norris search for porn on Google.", "categories": ["explicit"] } }
Internally, a RestTemplate object is used to retrieve the json item. The RestTemplate then process the item into a Joke object.

The app structure:
The main activity is started and loads its main fragment. The main fragment contains a 'fetch joke' Button When the button is pressed, the fragment uses an AsynchTask to acquire a joke. The AsynchTask will then load the joke into a TextView. The button, still visible, can be repeatedly pressed to return more jokes.
